## Recommended Next Steps

Based on current progress, the recommended next piece of work should be:

### FullScreenPhotoViewer Widget Tests
This is the logical next step because:
1. We've just completed PhotoGridView tests, so the widget testing infrastructure and patterns are fresh
2. FullScreenPhotoViewer is tightly coupled with PhotoGridView, so testing it now ensures complete coverage of the primary user flow
3. The test helpers and mocks we've created for PhotoGridView tests can be reused
4. It's a well-contained piece of work that can be completed in 1-2 days

Suggested branch name: `test/full-screen-viewer-widget-tests`

Key areas to test:
- Photo navigation (next/previous)
- Gesture controls
- Generation feature interaction
- Error states
- Image loading states
- UI controls visibility
